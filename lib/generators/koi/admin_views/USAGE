Description:
    Generates Koi admin CRUD views for the given model.

    When run without field:type arguments, the generator will automatically
    introspect the model's attributes and associations to generate appropriate
    admin views. This makes it easy to create admin views for existing models
    or re-generate views when models change.

Options:
    --force Overwrite existing view files

Example:
    bin/rails generate koi:admin_views Product name:string price:integer active:boolean

    This will create:
        app/views/admin/products/_fields.html.erb
        app/views/admin/products/edit.html.erb
        app/views/admin/products/index.html.erb
        app/views/admin/products/new.html.erb
        app/views/admin/products/show.html.erb

    For existing models, run without field arguments to auto-introspect:
    bin/rails generate koi:admin_views Product --force
