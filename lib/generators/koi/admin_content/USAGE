Description:

Example:

    This will create:
        app/controllers/admin/pages_controller.rb
        app/models/page.rb
        app/views/admin/pages/_fields.html.erb
        app/views/admin/pages/_page+html+row.erb
        app/views/admin/pages/edit.html.erb

        db/migrate/create_pages.rb
        specs/request/admin/page_controller_spec.rb
