Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views. The resource is ready to use as a starting point for your restful,
    resource-oriented application.

Usage:
    Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first
    argument along with an optional list of attribute pairs and controller actions.

    IMPORTANT: If no attribute pairs are specified, no model will be generated.
    It will try to determine the attributes from an existing model.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    For example, `rails generate koi:admin_controller post name:string content:text`
    gives you a model with those two attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

Examples
    To add a ordarable property to a model
    rails g koi:admin_controller post name:string content:text --orderable
